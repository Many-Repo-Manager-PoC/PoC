## Project Structure

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just an extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

Inside your project, you'll see the following directory structure:

```
├── public/
│   └── ...
└── src/
    ├── components/
    │   └── ...
    └── routes/
        └── ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory-based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

## GitHub Authentication Setup

This project uses GitHub OAuth for authentication. To set up GitHub authentication:

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click on "New OAuth App" to create a new application
3. Fill in the application details:
   - Application name: "Many Repo Manager" (or your preferred name)
   - Homepage URL: `http://localhost:5173` (for development)
   - Authorization callback URL: `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback/github`
4. Click "Register application"
5. You'll receive a Client ID and need to generate a Client Secret
6. Create a `.env` file in the root of the dashboard package with the following content:

```
AUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your_github_client_id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
```

Replace `your_random_secret_here` with a random string for session encryption, and use the Client ID and Client Secret from GitHub.

**Important Note:** The callback URL in your GitHub OAuth app settings must match exactly what your application is using. For Qwik with Auth.js, the default callback URL is `/auth/callback/github` (not `/api/auth/callback/github` as mentioned in some documentation).

## Add Integrations and deployment

Use the `npm run qwik add` command to add additional integrations. Some examples of integrations includes: Cloudflare, Netlify or Express Server, and the [Static Site Generator (SSG)](https://qwik.dev/qwikcity/guides/static-site-generation/).

```shell
npm run qwik add # or `yarn qwik add`
```

## Development

Development mode uses [Vite's development server](https://vitejs.dev/). The `dev` command will server-side render (SSR) the output during development.

```shell
npm start # or `yarn start`
```

> Note: during dev mode, Vite may request a significant number of `.js` files. This does not represent a Qwik production build.

## Preview

The preview command will create a production build of the client modules, a production build of `src/entry.preview.tsx`, and run a local server. The preview server is only for convenience to preview a production build locally and should not be used as a production server.

```shell
npm run preview # or `yarn preview`
```

## Production

The production build will generate client and server modules by running both client and server build commands. The build command will use Typescript to run a type check on the source code.

```shell
npm run build # or `yarn build`
```
